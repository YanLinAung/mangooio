# The main properties file to configure your application
#
# Properties can be prefixed by "%".
# "%"" matches a mode you can set as system property. For instance when you
# are using maven you can do: mvn -Dmode=test jetty:run
#
# Using that the following property:
# %test.myproperty=test property
# would overwrite the property
# myproperty=my property
#
# You can define as many environments as you want. Simply set them in the mode.
